'<strong><p>1. What these Terms cover.</p></strong>' +

'<strong><p>1.1.</strong><span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Cloud Products. </span> These Terms govern our Cloud Products, related Support, and Additional Services. These Terms include Our Policies (including our <a href = "#privacy" style = "color : blue;margin: 0%;" >Privacy Policy</a>), the Product-Specific Terms, and your Orders.</p>' +

'<strong><p>1.2.</strong><span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Product-Specific Term. </span><p>Some Cloud Products may be subject to additional terms specific to that product as set forth in the Product-Specific Terms. By accessing or using a product covered by the Product-Specific Terms, you also agree to the Product-Specific Terms.</p>' +

'<strong><p>2. How Cloud Products are administered.</p></strong>' +

'<strong><p>2.1.</strong><span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Administrators </span> Through the Cloud Products, you may be able to specify certain End Users as Administrators, who will have important rights and controls over your use of Cloud Products and End User Accounts. This may include making Orders for Cloud Products or enabling Apps (which may incur fees); creating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions; and managing access to Your Data by End Users or others. Administrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to your domain (which become “managed accounts”, as described in our Documentation). You are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above. You agree that our responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Products for you.</p>' +

'<strong><p>2.2.</strong><span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Reseller as Administrator. </span> If you order Cloud Products through a Reseller, then you are responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in your applicable agreement with the Reseller.  As between you and Atlassian, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other End User Accounts.</p>' +

You will provide evidence of such consents upon our reasonable request. </p>' +

'<strong><p>2.4.</strong><span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Responsibility for end users. </span> Our Cloud Products have various user onboarding flows. Some Cloud Products require users to be designated by Administrators; some allow users to sign up for individual accounts which can become associated with teams or organizations at a later time; and some may allow users to invite other users. You are responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Product you use and for controlling whom you allow to become an End User. If payment is required for End Users to use or access a Cloud Product, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Products to those End Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such End Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Products. You are responsible for compliance with these Terms by all End Users, including for any payment obligations. Please note that you are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including Orders they may place and how End Users use Your Data, even if those End Users are not from your organization or domain. </p>' +

All renewals are subject to the applicable Cloud Product continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.</p>' +

'<strong><p>8.3.</strong><span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Adding Users. </span> You may add users, or otherwise increase your use of Cloud Products by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, we will charge you for any increased use at our then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>' +


'<strong><p>8.4.</strong> <span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Software Products Not Covered. </span> You will pay all fees in accordance with each Order, by the due dates and in the currency specified in the Order. If a PO number is required in order for an invoice to be paid, then you must provide such PO number to Nanotech Soft-App by emailing the PO number to <a href = "mailto: support@niompmo.com style = "color : blue;margin: 0%;"> support@niompmo.com </a>. You agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>' +

'<strong><p>8.5.</strong><span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Delivery. </span> We will deliver the login instructions for Cloud Products to your account or through other reasonable means no later than when we have received payment of the applicable fees. You are responsible for accessing your account to determine that we have received payment and that your Order has been processed. All deliveries under these Terms will be electronic.</p>' +

"<strong><p>10. Taxes not included</p></strong>" +

'<strong><p>10.1.</strong> <span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Taxes. </span>. Your fees under these Terms exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by us, you must pay to us the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed, you may provide us with such exemption information, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with invoicing documents designed to enable you to obtain a refund or credit from the relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.</p>' +

'<strong><p>10.2.</strong><span style = "text-decoration:underline;" > Withholding Taxes. </span> You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes. You and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof. You will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.</p>' +

'<strong><p>12. No contingencies on other products of future functionality.</strong> You acknowledge that the Cloud Products and Additional Services referenced in an Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services. Payment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other products (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Products and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order). You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Products beyond the current Subscription Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.</p>' +

'<strong><p>13. Evaluations, trials, and betas.</strong>We may offer certain Cloud Products (including some Nanotech Soft-App Apps) to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, <strong>“No-Charge Products”</strong>). Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or, if not designated, until terminated in accordance with these Terms). Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 14, the terms and conditions of these Terms governing Cloud Products, including Section 3.3 (Restrictions), fully apply to No-Charge Products. We may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and beta Cloud Products, and any pre-release and beta features within generally available Cloud Products, that we make available (collectively, <strong>“Beta Versions” </strong>) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Cloud Products. We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 14. All information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support, warranty and indemnity obligations.</p>' +

'<strong><p>14. IP Rights in the Cloud Products and Feedback.</strong> Cloud Products are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”. We and our licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Our Technology (including the Cloud Products). From time to time, you may choose to submit Feedback to us. We may in connection with any of our products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. No Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in these Terms limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>' +

"<strong><p>15. Confidentiality</strong>  Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party ('Receiving Party') by the disclosing party ('Disclosing Party') constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any of Our Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Products will be deemed our Confidential Information without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations. The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such </p>" +

'<strong><p>16.2.</strong> <span style = "text-decoration:underline;" >Termination for Cause.</span>.

You will certify such deletion upon our request. You will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after expiration or termination of these Terms (or its applicable Subscription Term), so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Products during the applicable Subscription Term. In no event will termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under these Terms, by law or otherwise.</p>' +

'<strong><p>19. IP Indemnification. </strong> We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third party alleging that the Cloud Products, when used as authorized under these Terms, infringe any third-party patent, copyright or trademark, or misappropriates any third-party trade secret enforceable in any jurisdiction that is a signatory to the Berne Convention (a <strong> “Claim” </strong>), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded on the Claim by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to via settlement executed by us (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation of the Claim, including providing us a copy of the Claim, all relevant evidence in your possession, custody, or control, and cooperation with evidentiary discovery, litigation, and trial, including making witnesses within your employ or control available for testimony; and (c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the Claim.
